			<div className="prose prose-invert max-w-none">
				<p>We combine experienced craftsmanship with modern tooling to deliver consistently accurate stone fabrication. Whether you need a single vanity top or a full villa package we maintain the same attention to detail in measurement, edge finish and polish depth.</p>
				<p>Materials we process daily include <strong>Granite</strong>, <strong>Kadappa</strong>, <strong>Nano White</strong>, <strong>Marble</strong>, <strong>Quartzite</strong> and engineered <strong>Quartz</strong>. Each piece is inspected for fissures and colour consistency before cutting to minimise waste and avoid surprises on site.</p>
				<p>Our workflow: templating → optimized cutting → edge profiling & shaping → progressive grit polishing → sealing (where required) → inspection → protected transport → on‑site fitting. This closed loop ensures speed without sacrificing finish.</p>
